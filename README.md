Write a function named **find_median** that takes as a parameter a list of numbers.  The function should return the statistical median of those numbers, which will require it to sort the list. Remember that the calculation is different for odd and even groups of values. If you're not familiar with calculating the median, check out [this page](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/mean-median-basics/a/mean-median-and-mode-review)).  Remember that the same group of numbers should always have the **same** median, regardless of what order the numbers were listed in.

For example, it could be used like this:
```
some_nums = [13,7,-3,82,4]
result = find_median(some_nums)
```

The file must be named: find_median.py
